#1. Create a while loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 0
#and then prints "Hello World!" at the end.

#i = 5
#while i >= 0:
 #    print(i)
  #   time.sleep(1)
  #   i -= 1
#else:
#    print("Hello World")



#2. Create a while loop that prints only even numbers
#between 1 and 30.
#e = 0
#while e <= 30:
#    print(e)
#    time.sleep(1)
#    e += 2

#3. Create a while loop that repeats until the user
#inputs the number 0.
o = 0
o = int(input("enter a number"))
while o <= 10000:
    print(o)
    time.sleep(0.2)
    o += 1
