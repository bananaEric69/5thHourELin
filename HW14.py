#1. Create a variable that asks the user for an integer and an empty integer variable.
print("Please enter an integer")
p = (int(input()))


#2. Create a loop with a range from 1 to the number the user input.
i = 1
for k in range (1, p + 1):
    i *= k
print(i)

#3. Use the loop to find the factorial of that number. A factorial of a number is that number multiplied
#by every number before it until you reach 1.
#For example: 5! is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

#4. Print the factorial.
